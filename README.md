# Executive Decision Dashboard – Business Performance & Strategy

## Executive Summary

Senior leaders require a clear, concise view of business performance to enable timely and effective decision-making.
This project delivers an **executive decision dashboard** that synthesizes sales data into **action-oriented insights**, allowing leadership to quickly identify performance drivers, risk areas, and strategic priorities.

The dashboard is designed with a **consulting-first mindset** — focusing not on data complexity, but on **clarity, relevance, and decisions**.

---

## Problem Context

Leadership teams often face challenges due to:

* Fragmented performance reports
* Overly operational dashboards with limited strategic insight
* Lack of clear prioritization for action

The objective of this project was to design a **single, executive-level dashboard** that answers three critical questions:

1. How is the business performing overall?
2. What is driving or constraining profitability?
3. Where should leadership focus immediate action?

---

## Data Overview

* **Dataset:** Retail / E-commerce (Superstore – Kaggle)
* **Scope:** Sales, profitability, products, regions, and customer segments
* **Granularity:** Transaction-level data aggregated for executive use

The dataset was cleaned and structured to ensure consistency, accuracy, and decision-ready metrics.

---

## Key Performance Indicators

The dashboard tracks a focused set of leadership-relevant KPIs:

* Total Revenue
* Total Profit
* Profit Margin (%)
* Order Volume
* Revenue Growth Trends
* Regional Contribution to Revenue
* Product & Category Profitability

Each KPI was selected to directly support strategic evaluation rather than operational reporting.

## Dashboard Architecture

### 1. CEO Overview

Provides a consolidated snapshot of overall business health:

* Revenue, profit, and margin KPIs
* Monthly revenue trend analysis
* Region-wise revenue contribution

**Objective:** Enable leadership to assess performance status within seconds.

---

### 2. Product & Customer Insights

Examines the underlying drivers of performance:

* Profitability by product category
* Identification of top and low-performing products
* Revenue contribution by customer segment

**Objective:** Highlight profit drivers and areas requiring optimization.

---

### 3. Executive Decision View

Translates analysis into action:

* Classification of business areas into:

  * **Focus Areas** (high-margin, high-impact)
  * **Improve Areas** (strong revenue, margin pressure)
  * **Risk Areas** (low-margin or weak performers)
* Tables highlighting priority products, categories, or regions

**Objective:** Support clear prioritization and leadership action.

---

## Key Insights

* Profitability is concentrated within a limited set of categories and products, suggesting targeted scaling opportunities.
* Certain high-revenue segments operate with constrained margins, indicating pricing or cost-efficiency levers.
* Clear differentiation exists between areas suitable for immediate investment versus those requiring corrective action.

---

## Strategic Recommendations

* Accelerate investment in high-margin focus areas to maximize return on capital.
* Optimize pricing, sourcing, or operational efficiency in margin-constrained segments.
* Review low-performing products for restructuring, re-pricing, or exit.
* Align marketing and growth initiatives with the most profitable customer segments.

---

## Tools & Approach

* **Power BI:** Executive dashboard design and visualization
* **SQL:** KPI logic and analytical structuring
* **Excel:** Data cleaning and validation

The approach mirrors a consulting engagement — from problem framing to insight generation and strategic recommendation.

---

## Outcome

This project demonstrates the ability to:

* Structure ambiguous data into executive-ready insights
* Design decision-focused dashboards for senior stakeholders
* Apply consulting-style problem solving within a business analytics context
